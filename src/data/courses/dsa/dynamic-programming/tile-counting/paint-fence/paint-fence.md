N posts, K colors. No more than 2 consecutive posts same color. Count ways.

> Input: n=3, k=2
> Output: 6
> **Key insight:** dp[i] = (k-1) * (dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]). Same as prev: k-1 choices. Different from prev: k-1 choices for each of dp[i-2] arrangements.

## Solution 1: Recursion (Brute Force)

**Intuition:**
The most straightforward approach — try all possibilities and check each one.

**Algorithm:**
1. For each element i (outer loop):
   - For each element j (inner loop):
     - Check if the pair/condition is satisfied
2. Return the best result found

### Time Complexity: O(K^N)
**Why?**
Single pass through the input, doing O(1) work per element.
Total: N elements × O(1) per element = O(N).

**Detailed breakdown:**
For N=100,000: ~100,000 operations — very efficient.

### Space Complexity: O(1) extra (or O(N) if using auxiliary structures)
**Why?**
Depends on whether auxiliary data structures are used. Pure brute force typically uses O(1) extra space beyond the input.

> **Drawback:**
> Suboptimal time complexity for large inputs. Redundant work is performed.

> **Key Insight for Improvement:**
> Use a more efficient data structure or algorithm to reduce redundant computation.

## Solution 2: DP — Bottom-up with two variables

**Recurrence:** `dp[i] = (k-1) * (dp[i-1] + dp[i-2])`

**Algorithm:** Bottom-up with two variables

### Time Complexity: O(N)
**Why?** Each state computed exactly once. Total states × O(1) per state transition.

**Detailed breakdown:** Depends on input size, but each state visited once.

### Space Complexity: O(1)

**Example walkthrough:**
```
k=2: dp[1]=2, dp[2]=4, dp[3]=1*(4+2)=6
```

## Complexity Progression Summary

| Solution | Time | Space | Key Improvement |
|----------|------|-------|----------------|
| Recursion | O(K^N) | O(N) stack | Brute force, overlapping subproblems |
| Memoization | O(N) | O(N) | Cache computed states |
| Tabulation | O(N) | O(1) | Bottom-up, possible space optimization |

**Key Insights:**
1. **Identify recurrence:** Express dp[i] in terms of smaller subproblems
2. **Base cases:** Starting values that don't depend on other states
3. **Space optimization:** If dp[i] only depends on dp[i-1] and dp[i-2], use two variables instead of array
