Same as unique paths but with obstacles (grid[i][j]=1 means blocked).

<br>

> grid=[[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]] → 2
> **Key insight:** Same recurrence but dp[i][j]=0 if obstacle. Obstacle blocks all paths through that cell.

## Solution 1: Recursion (Brute Force)

**Intuition:**
The most straightforward approach — try all possibilities and check each one.

**Algorithm:**
1. For each element i (outer loop):
   - For each element j (inner loop):
     - Check if the pair/condition is satisfied
2. Return the best result found

### Time Complexity: O(2^(m+n))
**Why?**
Each element has multiple choices (include/exclude, take/skip), leading to exponential branching.
For N elements, the total states explored grow as 2^N or worse.

**Detailed breakdown:**
For N=20: ~1 million states. For N=30: ~1 billion states — too slow.

### Space Complexity: O(1) extra (or O(N) if using auxiliary structures)
**Why?**
Depends on whether auxiliary data structures are used. Pure brute force typically uses O(1) extra space beyond the input.

> **Drawback:**
> Suboptimal time complexity for large inputs. Redundant work is performed.

> **Key Insight for Improvement:**
> Use a more efficient data structure or algorithm to reduce redundant computation.

## Solution 2: DP — Bottom-up with obstacle check

**Recurrence:** `dp[i][j] = 0 if obstacle, else dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]`

### Time Complexity: O(m×n)
**Why?** Each state computed once.

**Detailed breakdown:** States × transition cost

### Space Complexity: O(n)

**Example walkthrough:**
```
3×3 with obstacle at (1,1): only 2 paths around it
```

## Complexity Progression Summary

| Solution | Time | Space |
|----------|------|-------|
| Recursion | O(2^(m+n)) | O(N) stack |
| Memoization | O(m×n) | Same as tabulation |
| Tabulation | O(m×n) | O(n) |

**Key Insights:**
1. Identify recurrence and base cases
2. Optimize space if dp[i] depends only on previous row/state
